# Memories

A Full Stack Social Media App made using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node).

Users can sign in using their emails or using the Google Oauth integrated within this application, and can create posts, add relevant tags and descriptions as well.

It also has the feature of Search, which allows users to quickly find their favourite posts amidst thousands.

Another interesting feature is Commenting underneath the posts and it also suggests posts similar to that, when an user opens a specific post.
